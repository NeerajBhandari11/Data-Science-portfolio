# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

Employee attrition, also known as Employee Turnover occurs when employees voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company. Voluntary attrition happens when the employee leaves the company seeking better opportunities whereas involuntary attrition occurs when the employees are terminated or laid off by the organization.

Attrition is the measure of the rate at which the employee leaves the organization over a given period.

High attrition can have significant implications for an organization. It can disrupt workflow, reduce productivity and increase recruitment and training costs. Some reasons for attrition can be improved work-life balance, higher salaries, work environment, or more favorable working conditions. We can perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset and find other reasons for attrition.

We will develop an attrition prediction model to predict the employees at high risk of leaving the organization. 

We will be using Kaggle's IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset for this analysis, and it has 35 features with 1470 rows of employee data.
