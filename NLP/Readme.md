## This project is to classify the twitter data provided for each user and to predict the Gender of the user ID provided in the test dataset. To perform this task following steps are followed:

After loading Test and Train dataset into program the Userid is extracted from both into a list.
Twitter data for each userid is fecthed from the xml file provided for each user.
Text processing and the feature extraction process is done for tweets once after we extract data for all user from the unstructured data file and convert the extracted data into suitable format.
After preprocessing, we split user data into train and test based on the user ID provided in Train and Test dataset respectively.
Using the preprocessed data and extracted feature the classifier model is built to predict the gender of the user data is fed into classifier to predict
